# Bluegill_Sex_Program
Determining Bluegill Sex using a combination of PCA and SVM on self collected dataset of scale samples.

The dataset is not included, code can be used to convert JPG to .npy and produce a seperate data and labels file for binary classifcation.

See the research paper I wrote for details, which is also in this repository.
